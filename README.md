🚀 My Journey

This was my first ML hackathon and only my second hackathon ever. I started small—literally one hour of Pandas practice from Programming with Mosh—but I set a big goal: reach the top 50.

Over three intense days:

Made 15 submissions (the maximum allowed), iteratively improving features and models.

Learned feature engineering, model optimization, and validation strategies on the fly.

Endured frustration, sleepless nights, and self-doubt—but also growth, patience, and resilience.


This challenge taught me that growth isn’t linear. Every failed attempt added experience equivalent to months of work in a compressed timeframe.
